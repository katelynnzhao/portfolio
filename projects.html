                    The objective of this project was to create and improve an 
                    app through App Inventor.  After finishing the tutorial, my  
                    partner and I added many other features such as being able 
                    to rotate pictures, being able to draw on them, and being 
                    able to delete and save them.  While my partner and I were 
                    working on our project, we faced many problems.  Having enough 
                    space for all of the buttons and not being able to control 
                    which box the image went in were only two of problems that we 
                    had.  Through this project, I learned how to code and create 
                    an app through a program that I have never used before.

                    The objective of this project was to create a program that 
                    modifies images to the user's preferences.  After brainstorming
                    ideas, we decided on making a program that allowed the user
                    to choose the color of the border and which sticker they want
                    to paste on the corner of the image.  While my partner and I were 
                    working on our project, we faced many problems.  Making images
                    transparent and making the code interactive were some of the 
                    problems that we needed to fix.  Through this project, I learned
                    how to code using Python and create unqiue art.
