                    <p class="col-sm-7">Hi, my name is Katelyn Zhao.  I am 
                    currently a freshman at Dublin High School.  As of right 
                    now, I am unsure of what I want to do in the future.  
                    However, I plan on taking many courses over the next few 
                    years to see what I am interested in. <br></br> 
                    I participate in many extracirricular activities such as dance 
                    and volleyball.  I was the team captain of both my club and 
                    school teams and I was voted MVP of my volleyball team during 
                    my freshman year.  Some of my major accomplishments from school
                    are getting the Seal of Biliteracy for English and Spanish
                    as well as becoming a Dublin H.S. Scholar Athlete.  I have
                    participated in many volunteer activites through Interact, a 
                    community service club at Dublin High School.<br></br>
                    Some things that I have learned about myself through these
                    experiences are that I learn quickly and am able to effectively
                    work with people.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and I encourage you to explore 
                    the rest of this site.</p>
